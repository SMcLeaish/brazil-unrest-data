# Analysis of Political Unrest Surrounding the 2022 Brazilian Presidential Election

In October 2022, following the second round of voting in the closest presidential election in Brazil to date, the Superior Electoral Court ruled that Lula da Silva had won over
then incumbent president Jair Bolsonaro.

In the aftermath, Bolsonaro refused to concede the victory, calling on the Superior Electoral Court to invalidate votes an amount of votes that would have left him with 51% of the count. There was a wave of protests in response,
culminating in January 2023 with Bolsonaro supporters storming the offices of the National Congress, the Presidential Palace, and the Supreme Federal Court, in an attempt to overthrow the
newly sworn in government. Bolsonaro was convicted of attempting to overthrow the government on September 25, 2025 and sentenced to 27 years in prison.
